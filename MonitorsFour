“Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.” - Arthur Schopenhauer


for todays machine, lets do a windows one, an active one, MonitorsFour - rated as Easy - Windows since we are a bit tired of linux 


as always connect to the hackthebox VPN, then we spawn the machine, and remember that mindset + methodology is more important than just typing in random tool commands that give you too much information that is not needed.

speed comes from clarity, not rushing. Do not just run scripts and expect luck, insted inspect, document and analyze. 

after our machine finally boots we get an IP 10.129.5.240 ---- as always I recommend a good sporify "hacking" playlist to get in the mood, always

ping 10.129.5.240

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 176.628/178.948/180.670/1.703 ms

we have positive connection to our ip target, no packet loss, 

simply typing in the IP to our browser redirects to http://monitorsfour.htb/ yet we get a "This site can’t be reached" so we need to add to /etc/hosts file

sudo nano /etc/hosts
add in at the bottom the target ip and the target machine name
-> 
control o -> control x

cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts

we pull up the page, MonitorsFour is a networking and IT infrastructure services company, delivering end-to-end networking solutions. That obviously needs our help. we see several issues already. 

lets start the enumeration process

nmap -sC -sV monitorsfour.htb -oA monitorsfour-services

key observations: nginx web server
The site sets a PHPSESSID cookie - HttpOnly flag is not set
Port 5985/tcp is open — WinRM (Microsoft HTTPAPI 2.0) -> some research tells us that this is for powershell access- admin access

from here we go to the login page, very simple, we go to inspect ->

------------------

and we see something alarming, type="text/javascript" src="static/admin/assets/js/core/libraries/jquery.min.js"></script>

yes the folder named admin, and admin panel / admin theme in usage, the login page is probably part of an admin module. With assests being loaded from static/admin/assets/... this is lazy cmon guys 

on the main page -> inspect ->

----> this is a huge enumeration win, and sloppy by the monitorsfour site devs.

lets recap, Error disclosure (full filesystem paths, router file/line numbers).
Direct access to /views/* and /views/admin/*
WinRM on 5985



lets go through http://monitorsfour.htb/views/admin/users.php & http://monitorsfour.htb/views/admin/api.php 

once we pull them up we can see that admin pages are accessible without a session, we only used feroxbuster and even then without feroxbuster, the inspect element on the webpages would have presented these vulnerabilities 



http://monitorsfour.htb/views/admin/users.php -> gives us a page, -> Main

Generate New API Key


all bad for them, good for us. 
we might be able to add in a user, and generate an API key all without creating a login, 

lets try for both, without burpsuite, lets inspect -> network 

http://monitorsfour.htb/views/admin/api.php -> Generate API Key -> http://monitorsfour.htb/login 

http://monitorsfour.htb/views/admin/users.php -> Add User -> Warning: Undefined variable $superuser in /var/www/app/views/admin/users.php on line 44
#	Username	Name	Position	D.O.B	Start Date	Salary
No users found.
Add User -> empty fields to add in a user, 


Direct forced-browsing to /views/admin/* still works, but any “real” privileged action you click (Generate API Key) is routed to /login, 
meaning the backend action endpoint is enforcing auth but the /view itself isn’t.

lets do an html dump, curl -s http://monitorsfour.htb/views/admin/users.php | sed -n '1,200p'

we get good results -> 

/admin/dashboard

/admin/tasks

/admin/invoices

/admin/users

/admin/customers

/admin/changelog

/admin/api

So /views/admin/users.php is basically a template, but the intended entrypoints are the /admin/* routes.


sooo forced-browsing bypass is possible, but so far all actions are gated 



------------------


Request URL http://monitorsfour.htb/api/v1/auth Request Method POST Status Code 302 
Found Remote Address hmmm when we try to add a user with that role, with a simple name and password, 
then we go to login, typed that in we get a Invalid credentials, check your username and password then try again!

What this tells us ---> 

/api/v1/auth is authentication only

soooo  ---->

add user UI did not create a user
backend correctly enforces auth on /api/v1/auth

The “Add User” modal is purely cosmetic when accessed via forced browsing 

so this was a good misdirection, we like this box, lets look for config / env files now 

curl -i http://monitorsfour.htb/controllers/ HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden Server: 

nginx Date: Sun, 14 Dec 2025 00:06:30 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 146 Connection: keep-alive


----> nothing 

curl -i http://monitorsfour.htb/.env HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx Date: Sun, 14 Dec 2025 00:07:18 GMT Content-Type: application/octet-stream Content-Length: 97

Accept-Ranges: bytes DB_HOST=mariadb DB_PORT=3306 DB_NAME=monitorsfour_db DB_USER=monitorsdbuser DB_PASS=f37p2j8f4t0r 


wow look at that!!! a simple curl and we get something very good, we found the intended pivot. Critical find!

DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=monitorsfour_db
DB_USER=monitorsdbuser
DB_PASS=f37p2j8f4t0r


lets try the login page and test the following

Username: monitorsdbuser & Password: f37p2j8f4t0r 

---------------> Invalid credentials, check your username and password then try again!

so thats not the right place, hmmm remmeber that port? Port 5985/tcp is open — WinRM (Microsoft HTTPAPI 2.0) 

we try again here and it doesnt work either -----> 

These are database-only credentials, not OS or app-login creds. 

MariaDB is internal-only (expected) ----> DB port 3306 is not exposed ----------->>> So the DB creds must be abused through the app

That means the next step is data extraction, not auth guessing. -----------> 


hmmmmm,  

nmap -p 3306 -Pn monitorsfour.htb                     

Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-12-13 18:21 CST

hmmmmm,

sooo thats why we cannot connect directly, ---->  3306/tcp filtered mysql --->  there’s no direct DB access --->  no “easy SQLi on login” path. ---> well then lol 


we try for LFI but find nothing, 


hmmmm, lets try some more fuffing, admittly, here to make this shortwe we will only place the one that found us the next step, but in reality this took me longer than I care to admit
