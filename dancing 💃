As always,we begin with pinging the server to ensure our connection is working correctly.


└─$ ping -c3 10.129.16.51
PING 10.129.16.51 (10.129.16.51) 56(84) bytes of data.

Now we run our trustworthy Nmap

└─$ nmap -T4 -A -vv 10.129.16.51
Nmap can sometimes take a while so be patient

and viola! we got some good info back.



Remember the OS matters, it will affect what comes later.
 
We notice that port 135 is running msrpc, (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call) which is an offshoot extension of regular remote procedure call.

RPC's basically help developers or sys admins control and execute code as if they were on the same computer hosting the server.

So what switch do we use to connect to the RPC? EASY! we use smbclient!
why do we use SMBclient?

trying to log in with the -L switch we see that we are unable to connect since there is no workgroup assigned when entering...

we notice that the sharename WorkShares is with an $, denoting a path forward, so we could enter that group. We add it into our command line.

└─$ smbclient \\\\10.129.197.179\\WorkShares
Enter WORKGROUP\redbull's password:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls

we see that it works! We just add in the name to the file directory path denoted in the / lines. Such as when you use the Linux file system, 
another path is set by the / line.

so we ls and we get .                                   D        0  Mon Mar 29 03:22:01 2021

  flag.txt            

after we find the flag we use the get command to retrieve it

smb: \James.P\> get flag.txt
getting file \James.P\flag.txt of size 32 as flag.txt (0.0 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.0 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \James.P\>

now we exit from server and cat flag.txt to reveal the HTB flag.
